        </figure>
        Although both were born in the Basque region of Spain, Joaquin Bagüés and Dionisia Jimenez first met in Mauleon, France while working
        at a local company that made sandals. The couple married, and had their first child, Hilario, in 1901. A daughter, Angela Clara,
        soon followed. It was not long before tragedy struck the young family however, for Angela Clara died of the measles around the age of two.<br>
        Stricken with grief and needing a change, Joaquin, Dionisia, and two of Dionisia's brothers and her mother, Juana Gia Bisauta
        migrated to Mexico. Settling in Mexico City, the family tried to start a business making wine barrels, but couldn't find the 
        right type of wood, so their barrels leaked. Disappointed again, the family migrated yet again, this time to the United States.<br>                 
        Entering the U.S. through Texas, they moved to Oakland, California and started working in a French Laundry. After a time they 
        bought their own laundry company in Martinez, California. It was during this time that their second son; who is my paternal grandfather;
        Frank, was born. Again, difficulties in language and experience caused their business to fail, and they went back to working for others.<br>
        When their oldest son, Hilario, began school his name was anglicized to Harry Bagnes. Soon after Frank also officially became
        a Bagnes in the same manner. When the family had a third son, Edwin, he too was listed as a Bagnes. The name has continued in the
        family ever since.+

        Basque Origins: No one really knows where the Basque; who call them self Euskaldun; or their language, Euskara, originated. They are believed to have
        lived in the northern part of the Iberian Pennisula and southern France for millenia; and some scholars believe they are a remnant of a 
        pre-Indo-European population of Europe. A study of the genetics of the Basque people have shown that the Basques share unique genetic 
        patterns that distinguish them from the surrounding non-Basque populations. Interestingly, the Basque people do share a haplogroup, R1b,
        in common with the Celtic Welsh, and Irish; and one researcher has suggested that a group of Basque may have migrated from the Pennisula to
        the regions of Wales and Ireland sometime during the last ice age.<br>
        Like the Basques genetic distinctness, the Basque language is also distinct from the other languages found in the region and its surroundings.
        A common theory is that it originated in a pre-Indo-European population of Europe, and is closely related to the Iberian Language that existed
        in the region since antiquity. If so, the Basque language appears to have remained largely unchanged for millenia; unaffected by migaration
        and other factors. A separate theory focuses on similiarities between the Basque language and the Caucasian languages of Georgia. But DNA analysis
        of the populations of the two regions suggest no close relationship between them, and many now believe the connection was based entirely upon
        superficial similiarities. Whatever their origin, all researchers agree they share fewer genetic commonalities
        with the other populations of Europe; suggesting long periods of isolation.+

        Basque Culture: Most modern Basques identify themselves by the term euskaldun and their country as Euskal Herria, literally "Basque speaker", or "Country of the Basque Language."
        In connection with this attitude the Basque people have sought, and in some regions, won political autonomy within the countries of Spain and France, although
        the majority speak both Basque and the official languages of French or Spanish in those countries.<br>
        Like many other cultures, the Basque have developed their cuisine based upon sources available locally. An interesting modern feature of Basque culture is the phenomenon
        of gastronomical societies (txoko), food clubs where men gather to cook and enjoy their own food. Until recently, women were allowed entry only one day in the year.<br>
        Basque traditional music is a product of the region's historic development and strategic geographical position on the Atlantic arch at a crossroads between mountains,
        and has seen influences throughout history, ranging from British and northern European to Mediterranean to Arabic. Most instruments used in the Basque country were introduced
        sometime in the last six centuries. These include theAlboka, a double clarinet, Kirikoketa, a wooden percussion device associated with the cider making process. Toberak, a 
        percussion instrument made of horizontal metal bars. Txistu, a local flute. danbolin, a drum usually used to accompanying the txistu.
        Atabal, a double sided, portable flat drum. Xirula, a three-hole flute, shorter and more high-pitched than txistu.
        Ttun-ttun, a vertical stringed drum. Trikitixa or eskusoinua, a lively diatonic button accordion. Tambourine. And the Dulzaina, a Navarre-based pipe.
        Only the Txalaparta, a wooden xylophone-like percussion instrument for two players originated in the Basque region.<br>
