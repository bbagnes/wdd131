        Basque Origins: No one really knows where the Basque; who call them self Euskaldun; or their language, Euskara, originated. They are believed to have
        lived in the northern part of the Iberian Pennisula and southern France for millenia; and some scholars believe they are a remnant of a 
        pre-Indo-European population of Europe. A study of the genetics of the Basque people have shown that the Basques share unique genetic 
        patterns that distinguish them from the surrounding non-Basque populations. Interestingly, the Basque people do share a haplogroup, R1b,
        in common with the Celtic Welsh, and Irish; and one researcher has suggested that a group of Basque may have migrated from the Pennisula to
        the regions of Wales and Ireland sometime during the last ice age.<br>
        Like the Basques genetic distinctness, the Basque language is also distinct from the other languages found in the region and its surroundings.
        A common theory is that it originated in a pre-Indo-European population of Europe, and is closely related to the Iberian Language that existed
        in the region since antiquity. If so, the Basque language appears to have remained largely unchanged for millenia; unaffected by migaration
        and other factors. A separate theory focuses on similiarities between the Basque language and the Caucasian languages of Georgia. But DNA analysis
        of the populations of the two regions suggest no close relationship between them, and many now believe the connection was based entirely upon
        superficial similiarities. Whatever their origin, all researchers agree they share fewer genetic commonalities
        with the other populations of Europe; suggesting long periods of isolation.+
