            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img class="profilepic" src="images/brigham_bagnes.jpg" alt="Brigham Bagnes - 2014">
            <p>I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America, and am the youngest of eight children; all of whom live in Utah. Despite my large family; whom I love; I am largely an introvert. Which makes becoming a programmer an ideal career for me; because I can work from home, and have fewer social interations than most jobs require. My personal interests include genealogical research and watching C & K dramas.<br><br></p>

            <p>The state of Utah is named for the Ute indian tribe who; along with the Navajo and Paiute tribes; inhabited the region prior to it's settlement by early pioneers. Utah became an official state in 1896. Prior to this time the region was called by settlers the "state of Deseret," or "Deseret Territory," and covered a much larger area than the state's current boundaries. Due to resistance to its statehood by the U.S. government, the state of Deseret's size was greatly reduced; with portions becoming part of the surrounding states of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Wyoming, and even California and Oregon. For the same reason, a change of name was also required. Because the process towards statehood was delayed, the state of Utah ending up being the 45th state to join the United States of America.</p>
